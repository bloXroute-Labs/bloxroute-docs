# Ethereum Miner Test

Thank you for agreeing to participate in bloXroute Ethereum Mining Pool test. The following document is meant to guid you through installation of the software needed for the bloXroute Ethereum mainnet test.

The test will consist of two phases: a first phase (Phase 1) without the bloXroute Gateway to establish a baseline, followed by a second phase (Phase 2) using the bloXroute Gateway to establish performance. 

The test will require that each participant install two separate pieces of software provided by bloXroute, the first is called the Blockchain-Logger and the second is our bloXroute Gateway. The Blockchain-Logger will run during both phases of the test. The Gateway will run only during the second phase. Please use the links below to access the instructions for install the Blockchain-Logger and the Gateway.
